MathDOM - accessing terms through a MathML DOM in Python
--------------------------------------------------------

There is not much here yet. If you're interested, send me an email:
Stefan Behnel <scoder@users.sourceforge.net>

I'd be really glad to hear if this is useful. And maybe you have an
idea how to make it better. :)


What is MathDOM?
----------------

The package comprises parsers for a subset of Content MathML 2.0 and
infix terms. It provides access to the term tree through a DOM (based
on PyXML/4DOM) and allows serialization to Content MathML and literal
terms in infix or postfix notation.

If you want to test it, run any of the three main files from the "src"
directory.


The files:
----------

mathdom.py    - the DOM implemention

termparser.py - parser/serializer for literal terms, framework for
                converters

xmlterm.py    - SAX generator for the termparser AST

setup.py      - distutils, try "python setup.py install"


Have fun!
