MathDOM - accessing terms through a MathML DOM in Python
--------------------------------------------------------

There is not much here yet. If you're interested, send me an email:
Stefan Behnel <scoder@users.sourceforge.net>

I'd be really glad to hear if this is useful. And maybe you have an
idea how to make it better. :)


What is MathDOM?
----------------

The package comprises parsers for a subset of Content MathML 2.0 and
infix terms. It provides access to the term tree through a DOM (based
on PyXML/4DOM) and allows serialization to Content MathML and literal
terms in infix, prefix and postfix notation.

If you want to test it, run any of the three main files from the "src"
directory.


The files:
----------

* Installation:

setup.py          - distutils, try "python setup.py install"


* Examples are in "examples/":

examples/infix.py - example program: read a term, write out MathML,
                    infix, prefix, postfix representations
                    -> START HERE if you want to figure out how
                    everything works.


* The actual package source is in "src/":

src/mathdom.py    - the DOM implemention

src/xmlterm.py    - SAX generator for the termparser AST

src/termparser.py - parser/serializer for literal terms,
                    framework for converters


Have fun!
