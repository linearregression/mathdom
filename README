MathDOM - accessing terms through a MathML DOM in Python
--------------------------------------------------------

I'd be really glad to hear if this is useful. And maybe you have an
idea how to make it better. :) Just send me an email:

What is MathDOM?
----------------

The package comprises parsers for a subset of Content MathML 2.0 and
infix terms (using pyparsing [1]). It provides access to the term tree
through a DOM (based on PyXML/4DOM [2]) and allows serialization to
Content MathML and literal terms in infix, prefix and postfix
notation.

If you want to test it, run 'examples/infix.py'.


Current status:
---------------

* Short form:
This is alpha software. This means: it will spit into your coffee and
morph into a beast right in the second you take your eyes off it. You
have been warned.

* Long form:
There are definitely bugs in the implementation and the APIs are not
stable. You are very welcome to comment on them if you think they are
a) plain wrong
b) sort of OK, but could be better
c) the best you've ever seen

Every comment is appreciated, as are patches.


The files:
----------

* Installation:

setup.py          - distutils, try "python setup.py install"


* Examples are in "examples/":

examples/infix.py - example program: read a term, write out MathML,
                    infix, prefix, postfix representations
                    -> START HERE if you want to figure out how
                    everything works.


* The actual package source is in "src/":

src/mathdom.py    - the DOM implemention

src/xmlterm.py    - SAX generator for the termparser AST

src/termparser.py - parser/serializer for literal terms,
                    framework for converters
