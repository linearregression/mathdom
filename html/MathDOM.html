<p>MathDOM is a set of Python 2.4 modules (using <a
 href="http://pyxml.sourceforge.net/">PyXML</a> or <a
 href="http://codespeak.net/lxml/">lxml</a>, and <a
 href="http://pyparsing.sourceforge.net/">pyparsing</a>) that
import mathematical terms as a <a
 href="http://www.w3.org/TR/MathML2/chapter4.html">Content</a>
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/MathML2/">MathML</a> DOM. It currently
parses
MathML
and literal infix terms into a DOM or lxml document and writes out
MathML and
literal
infix/prefix/postfix/Python terms. The DOM elements are enhanced by
domain
specific
methods that
make using the DOM a little easier.</p>
<h2 style="clear: left;">What is it good for?</h2>
<p>You can call it the shortest way between different term
representations and a Content MathML DOM. Ever noticed the annoying
differences between terms in different programming languages? Build
your application around the DOM or lxml and stop caring about the term
representation that users prefer or that your machine can execute. If
you need a different representation, add a converter, but don't change
the model. Literal terms are connected through an intermediate AST step
that makes writing converters for C/Fortran/SQL/yourfavorite easier.</p>
<h2>Why PyXML <span style="font-style: italic;">and</span> lxml?</h2>
While basic XML support is part of the Python distribution, PyXML
extends it to a mostly complete DOM Level-2 compatible API written in
pure
Python. This implementation does, however, have the disadvantage of
being rather slow
and very, very un-pythonic. Appart from DOM, SAX and XPath, it
supports none of the other important XML specifications.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Entering </span><a
 style="font-weight: bold;" href="http://codespeak.net/lxml/">lxml</a><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">.</span> Based on <a
 href="http://xmlsoft.org/">libxml2</a>, lxml supports basically all of
the main XML specs (like XPath, XSLT, XInclude, etc.) and combines them
with the <a href="http://effbot.org/zone/element-index.htm">ElementTree</a>-API.
A few patches I wrote make it even more convenient for implementing
namespaces - like MathML. The patches are part of the MathDOM
distribution.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">So, why both?</span> The lxml
implementation is newer and will likely take
over the lead in the further evolution of MathDOM. Still, the PyXML
implementation is written in pure Python and can therefore be used
where lxml/libxml2 is not available.
<h2>MathML</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/MathML2/">MathML</a> is an XML
language for representing mathematics. <a
 href="http://www.w3.org/TR/MathML2/chapter4.html">Content MathML</a>
is a part of that specification that focuses on the semantics rather
than the representation of mathematical expressions.
MathML has received a lot of support in mathematical software as
well as browsers and represents a comfortable layer for the semantic
exchange of mathematics - see <a
 href="http://www.w3.org/Math/Software/">http://www.w3.org/Math/Software/</a></p>
<h2>And now, Python has it, too! :)</h2>
<p>I'd like to invite everyone who is interested to play with it and to
comment on the current (preliminary) state. Note that Content MathML
support is not complete, as the primary focus is on term
representation. It does, however, handle pretty complex things and I'd
be glad to see currently unsupported terms and MathML documents that
are worth being supported in the future.
